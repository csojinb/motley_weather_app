# current weather app thing!

### Intro
Greetings from South Korea! I'm a Django beginner, and I wrote this app in my spare moments whilst traveling abroad. So, it is quite plain, but it works. :-)

The weather data is sourced from the Weather Underground API.

### How to use
In the /weather directory, at the shell prompt, start the server:
``` 
$ python manage.py runserver
```
Then, direct your browser to (http://localhost:8000/current_conditions/). Enter the location information and hit "submit".

### Features to add
My WiFi situation is a bit dicey for the remainder of my time. I'd have liked to create an app with a little more meat, but I've posted it as-is for now in case I am not able to connect to add changes.

I'd like to add other methods of inputting location information, preferably with just one form. (A form for each type of location information would be easy, I think, but clunky both in the code and on the page.) A satellite image would be nice, and the list of weather attributes could be more elegant. Also, I'd like the page overall to look a little less 90s-vintage.
